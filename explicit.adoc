## Explicit Language for Clojure

Overview
--------

Have you ever found yourself uncertain about the result of calling a function in
Clojure? Unfortunately, dynamic languages like Clojure sometimes give you *too
much* flexibility.  They "helpfully" return nil when a sought-for object isn't
present, or perhaps convert one type into another in an effor to avoid problems.
The problem is, that _sometimes_ they do one thing, then _sometimes_ do something
else.  Which behavior you get depends on the context.  Since you can't always
tell the execution context when reading the code, you are left with
unpredictable (at least to you) code behavior.  Of course, since the code may
be run in a different context at some point in the future, what once worked
predictably can later become unpredictable (i.e. a bug).  

Map manipulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maps are convenient, especially when keywords are used as functions to look up a value in
a map.  Unfortunately, attempting to look up a non-existing keyword in a map will return
nil.  While sometimes convenient, this means that a simple typo in the keyword name will
silently return corrupted data (i.e. nil instead of the desired value.  The two funcitons
`grab` and `grab-in` are dop-in replacements for `get` and `get-in`, except that they will
throw an Exception in the event the keyword is not present in the map:

----
(grab m k)
  A fail-fast version of get. For map m & key k, returns the value v associated
  with k in m.  Throws an exception if k is not present in m.

(grab-in m ks)
  A fail-fast version of get-in. For map m & keys ks, returns the value v
  associated with ks in m, as for (get-in m ks). Throws an exception if the path
  ks is not present in m.
